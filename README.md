    Köttkrokar och Kristallkronor
    (a.k.a return of the placeholder gfx)
    (a.k.a mikz0r's premature 72h entry)

    --- intro -------
    you're stuck in a maze...
    food is on your side (when it's coming out of you)
    the mission: get out
    ----------------

    --- controls ------
    arrow keys - move
    space or ctrl - barf
    esc - back to menu

    eat food in order to barf on enemies (ie kill them)
    there's a limited supply of food (albeit far from little) so don't puke all over the place
    finish all three levels to win
    ------------------



    --- other notes -----
    the blob things speed up when approached, good timing or barfing from behind a wall is a winning strategy
    the knife guys stop right before shooting, pay attention

    i'm handing this entry in ~12hrs prematurely beacause i can't be at home for most of monday.
    also my gfx-guy crapped out on me so almost all the gfx are my placeholders

    i know the game is kinda hard, feel free to mess with the level-files to your hearts content. they're
    all in plain text (use a monospaced font or the map will look fucked)

    SDL included (www.libsdl.org)

    major thanks to lars-erik fredhammar for moral support
